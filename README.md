# Image Classifier
 
 Project Explanation: 
  
 In this project:
 
      -  I created my own image classifier using jupyter GPU workspace.
      -  The program determines which image classification algorithm works the "best" on classifying images as "dogs" or "not dogs".
      -  For this image classification; I used an image classification application using a deep learning model called CNN (Convolutional Neural Network).
 
 
I also used a dateset from [ImageNet](https://image-net.org/) fro CNN that has already learned the features.
